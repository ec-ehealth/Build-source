<p>Belgian federal profile for a patient. Initially based on the functional description of the NIHDI. Special remarks for KMEHR users: following elements in KMEHR are not available in this FHIR resource.
If needed, an extension can be defined in a future iteration of these specifications: the 'deathlocation' (location is not available but the death of the patient is expressed by either date or Boolean cfr. infra.),
the 'insurancystatus' (covered in a seperate FHIR resource: Coverage), 'insurancymembership' (covered in a seperate FHIR resource: Coverage) and 'profession' (covered in a possible future FHIR resource: OccupationalData.)</p>
